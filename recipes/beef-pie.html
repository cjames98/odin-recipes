    <p>
        Steak and ale pie is a classic British dish that combines tender pieces of beef with a rich and flavorful ale gravy. 
        The filling is encased in a flaky pastry crust and baked until golden brown. 
        This hearty and comforting pie is perfect for a cozy dinner on a cold night.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup ale</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 sheet puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and garlic to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the flour is lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the beef broth and ale, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the skillet and add the Worcestershire sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a baking dish. Roll out the puff pastry and place it over the filling, trimming any excess pastry. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
